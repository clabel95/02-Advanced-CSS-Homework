# 02 Advanced CSS: Portfolio
The point of this assignment was to create a portfolio page for myself based on the requirements provided.
## Wireframe

## Application
This Webpage is a mock portfolio page. The header bar is stuck to the top of the screen and displays my name, an image of me, and the nav bar. The nav bar takes the user to each labled section. The final option in the nav bar provides the user with a copy of my resume.

Below the header is the "About Me" section which has a title on the left and the info on the right.

Below that is my "work" section. It has 5 example projects with the first one being larger than the rest. Each project can be clicked to navigate the user to the corrosponding project. (This will be updated as I complete projects.)

Below the work section is the contact section. This section has three Icons that corospond to github linkedin and mail. By clicking any of the icons it will take the user to the authors corosponding website. I have also made it so that when you press the mail icon it opens up in gmail to send an email. I might change this later.
